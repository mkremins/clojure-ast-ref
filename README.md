# Clojure AST Quickref
A quick reference guide to the [abstract syntax tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) format produced by [tools.analyzer](https://github.com/clojure/tools.analyzer) and consumed by a variety of other Clojure tools.

## Caveats
I threw this together in a few hours to help me identify the discrepancies between the tools.analyzer AST format and the similar-but-distinct format used internally by the ClojureScript compiler. Then I decided to share it after the fact. I'm not (yet) a contributor to tools.analyzer myself, so I can't guarantee that this is 100% correct or up-to-date.

## Contributing
Pull requests welcome. If you see something wrong but don't have time to fix it yourself, file an issue and I'll take a look.
